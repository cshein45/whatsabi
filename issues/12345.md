# Update Test to Handle Multiple Verification Sources

The test in `src/__tests__/loaders.test.ts` is currently failing due to an assumption that a contract is only verified on Etherscan. However, the contract is now also verified on Sourcify, which causes the test to fail. 

To resolve this issue, the test should be updated to:
1. Not rely on external verification state.
2. Loosen the loader assertion.

For reference, see the failing test details in the GitHub Actions run: [Actions Run](https://github.com/shazow/whatsabi/actions/runs/16927405068/job/47965828010).
